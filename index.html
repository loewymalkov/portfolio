I will be updating this page periodically as I improve my skills.  Please feel free to poke around this website and let me know how I can improve. In the spirit of keeping this polished I am refraining from pasting a bunch of lorem. This means the text most likely will not be wrapping around the image when you read this. If you resize your tab to be small enough you should be able to see it float around the image!</p>

          <li class="bg-success">Completed highschool in Cambridge, MA.</li>
          <li class="bg-success">I moved to Portland, OR in 2010 for school (<em>Reed</em>)</li>
          <li class="bg-success"> I spent alot of my early 20s travelling, to <em>Europe</em> and <em>Asia</em>. Some of my favorite places are Nepal, India, Japan and Indonesia. </li>
          <li class="bg-info">Before I decided on a carreer change I worked in construction. Initially I worked in renovation work on older buildings and later got work as a general laborer (driving trucks, pick-up/material delivery, framing, concrete work, electrical, a bit of everything). My last position shifted towards plan submittal overview/project management work. Have about 5 years of experience in that field. It was a great way to keep in shape, learn new skills and I got decent at spanish.</li>
          <li class="bg-info">Before applying to Epicodus I spent a couple months learning Python via <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse's</a> program. It was great and convinced me I should enroll.</li>
          <li class="bg-warning">I spend some of my freetime working on a <a href="img/popupMiata.jpeg" alt="axmiata" class="text-info">car</a> I take to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocross" class="text-info">autocross</a> events. It's alot of fun and a sizeable money-pit. I do most of the work on the car myself, it's <strong>fun</strong> (sometimes it's horrible) and helps keep the cost of participation down.</li>
          <li class="bg-warning">I go see movies when I have time. Here's the last thing I saw at the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7131622/">theatre</a>.</li>

                <li>project goal was to create a page summarizing the first week's courses using bootsrap styling combined with previous html and css tools. We used the template provided by Epicodus for the text and structure but played with some of the formating.</li>
